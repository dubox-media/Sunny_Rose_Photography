            I have grown up all over Oregon, living in such places as Medford, Grants Pass, Klamath Falls, Salem, Keizer, Coos Bay,
            Coquille, Corvallis, Albany, and now North Portland.  I also spent a somewhat recent summer living in Richmond, Virginia!

            I am the only girl, of 4 children (3rd child), and I grew up as a total tom-boy!  I loved playing in the dirt and building forts with
            my brothers!  Our household was very nurturing of our individual talents/interests, which range from working on cars, to computer science, to physical fitness, to photography.  We all have many interests and enjoy sharing them with each other.

            I am married to such an amazing guy!  You could say we had a whirlwind romance, and in 2006 we tied the knot.We love children, but don’t yet have any of our own.  We look forward to the time when we get to start our family!

            I absolutely love animals, and I have fostered and rehabilitated many dogs and cats over the years.  I no longer do that due
            to urban life, but I do have one dog named Penny, and everyone just adores her because she’s so smart and well behaved!
        </p>

            My husband and I have big plans for our future!  We hope to have a large family, lots of land for playing and for growing
            fruits and veggies, a coop of chickens, and a spot for a family of little goats, a big tree with a tire swing, a porch that goes
            all the way around the house, a big grassy backyard where we can take the little kids “camping” for a night!
            What a great life that will be!

            For now, we are focused on working hard and achieving our goals.  My goal is to be a great photographer.  I have more to
            learn, and I still don’t have the nicest equipment out there, but its what I love to do, so I put my whole heart  into it!
            I hope you consider me when you need a photographer!
